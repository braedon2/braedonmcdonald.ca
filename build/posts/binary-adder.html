                My niece has a wooden toy with LEDs and switches that turn them on and off. I think the toy is really cute and for a long time I thought it would be cool to make one that does something a bit more involved. This fall I finally got around to following through with this idea and made a binary adder inspired by my nieces toy. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall I'm happy with how it turned out. It has a look and feel that is very similar to the box of switches and lights that my niece has.
            </p>
            <p>
                I made it with a scrap piece of wood from my yard and a 74LS83 chip. The chip has all the logic for adding two binary numbers in a nice little breadboard friendly package.

            <h2 class="page-subheading">How it works</h2>
            <p>
                The top row of LEDs is divided into three numbers. Starting from the left, the first four LEDs are red and represent the first number to be added. The next four LEDs are yellow and represent the second number to be added. The next five LEDs are blue and represent the resulting sum. The bottom row of switches control the numbers to be added, so the first four switches from the left control the red LEDs, and the next four switches control the yellow LEDs.
            </p>
            <p>
                Let's look at some examples.
            </p>
            <p>
                The following image shows the adder set to 1 + 1. In binary this is 0001 + 0001 = 00010, the LEDs that are on represent 1's and the LEDs that are off represent 0's.
            </p>

                <figcaption>1 + 1 = 2</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The following image shows the addtion of 0111 + 0011 = 01010 or 7 + 3 = 10 in decimal.
            </p>
            <figure>

                />
                <figcaption>7 + 3 = 10</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                The final example shows the fifth bit of the sum being used. This illustrates how you need five bits to add two four-bit numbers together due to overflow.
            </p>

                The circuit is straightfoward, I followed the <a href="/resources/7483.pdf">data sheet</a> for the 74LS83 chip to connect LEDs to the inputs and outputs. Then I added switches to control the inputs. The circuit is powered with a mini-USB breakout board.

                For the enclosure I took a scrap piece of 2x6 from the backyard, cut off a portion for the back, and hollowed it out with a drill press.

                Then holes were drilled for the LEDs and switches.

                After some staining and sanding, it's ready to be assembled.

                Then it was just a matter of mounting the LEDs and switches. Panel mount LED holders made this a breeze. Something that isn't shown is the hole drilled into the back to mount the USB port for power.

                Being a software developper, it's fun to show off a physical project to people. It's also fun to fiddle with at my desk and makes a nice decoration.
