                My niece has a wooden toy with LEDs and switches that turn them on and off. I think the toy is really cute and for a long time I thought it would be cool to make one that does something a bit more involved. Toggling switches is satisfying but wouldn't it be cool to learn binary at the same time? No, but I made a binary adder toy anyway.

                Overall I'm happy with how it turned out. It's a fun way of showing people the concept of binary numbers.

                I made it with a scrap piece of wood from my yard and a 74LS83 chip. The chip has all the logic for adding two binary numbers in a nice little breadboard friendly package.
